# aqgc
UFO model implementation of the dimension-eight electroweak SMEFT operators generating anomalous quartic gauge couplings

The model itself is in `aqgc_ufo` ([zip](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgdurieux%2Faqgc%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Faqgc_ufo)). The other files can be used to generate it with `FeynRules`.
